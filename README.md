# Saved Archiver for Reddit
## Introduction
Reddit allows only 1000 saved entries at one time. As more posts are saved, the oldest ones are lost forever. 
Saved Archiver is a simple script that allows you to archive all these saved Reddit posts and comments into 
one text file. The script can be run periodically to ensure that no older saved content is lost.
Additionally, Saved Archiver automatically downloads imgur links and albums, grouping content by username.
## Setup
todo: must set up API access to personal script via Reddit preferences. Replace fields in archiver.py with
values obtained via this process
